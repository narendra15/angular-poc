Dear Amit,

I am writing to sincerely apologize for the security incident that occurred on May 7, 2025, involving the use of an access card not assigned to me. I fully acknowledge that my actions were in violation of the TCS and BMO security protocols, and I take complete responsibility for this lapse in judgment.

The incident was an unintentional oversight on my part, and I deeply regret the inconvenience and concern it has caused. I understand the seriousness of the matter and recognize the importance of adhering strictly to access control policies in the workplace.

To ensure such an incident does not happen again, I have taken the following corrective actions:
	1.	Reviewed and familiarized myself with all relevant BMO and TCS security and access policies.
	2.	Re-completed the TCS Security and Compliance Training to reinforce my understanding of the protocols.

I assure you that this experience has been a valuable lesson, and I am committed to maintaining the highest standards of professionalism and compliance moving forward.


Thank you for your understanding, and I once again apologize for the oversight.


Dear Amit,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to extend my sincere apologies regarding the access incident that occurred on May 7. It was never my intention to cause any concern or disrupt the expected protocols.

The situation arose in a moment where I made a quick decision without fully considering the implications. In hindsight, I recognize that I should have approached the matter differently and sought appropriate guidance.

Since then, I’ve taken the time to reflect and understand the expectations around access management more thoroughly. I’ve also reviewed all relevant internal policies to ensure I’m aligned with the required standards going forward.

Please be assured that I am treating this matter with utmost seriousness and will exercise greater caution and clarity in future situations.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
