Dear Amit,

I am writing to sincerely apologize for the access incident that occurred on May 7, 2025, involving the use of Aditi’s access card.

It was an unintentional oversight, and I deeply regret any inconvenience or concern it may have caused. Since reading your email that day, I’ve made sure to strictly follow all BMO and TCS security policies.

To help ensure this does not happen again, I’ve enrolled in and re-completed the TCS iSecurity Training.

This experience has been a valuable lesson, and I am committed to maintaining the highest standards of professionalism and compliance moving forward.

Thank you for your understanding, and I once again apologize for the oversight.

Best regards,
Narendra
